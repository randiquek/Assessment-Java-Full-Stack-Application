# Assessment-Java-Full-Stack-Application

## Project Planning:

### Multiplayer Match-Making Server (if time permits)

Players can search for a match based on user info (such as level, role, or rank). Once matched, a game lobby is created.

#### Must Have
- User authentication
- Option to create or leave lobby
- Match player search algorithm based on level, role, or rank
- Party leader feature of adding/removing players

#### Could Have
- Chat lobby
- Ready check

#### Won't Have
- Functionality to start a game

### Administrator User Story
- User logs in
- User can choose to start a game from the menu
- User becomes party leader 
- Party leader can choose their role
- Party leader can begin search for other players based on roles needed (tank, damage, or healer)
- Once other players are found, game lobby is then created.
- Party leader can remove players and find new ones. 
- Party leader can then choose to start a game (but won't be functional)
- Party leader can also choose to disband party/delete the lobby, and is brought back to main menu to start a new game or exit.
