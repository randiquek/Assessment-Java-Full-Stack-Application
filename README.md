Project Planning:

//Party-Based Game Lobby System//

Players can log in or create an account with a username and password. Players will be able to create and join game lobbies.
Hosts of these lobbies can invite others, and remove players from a lobby. Other players within the lobby can join and leave. Possibly maybe a chat lobby to commmunicate? 
There is no actual functionality of being able to start a game, just a strictly a lobby server. Database will store user info and lobby info. Possible Websocketing for Real-time updates?

//Multiplayer Match-Making Server (if time permits)//

Players can search for a match based on user info (such as level, role, or rank). Websocket for notification of match found. Once matched, a game lobby is created. Possible a feature for player ready check.
