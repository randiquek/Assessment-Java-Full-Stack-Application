# Assessment-Java-Full-Stack-Application

## Project: Game Discovery App
This is an app where a user can browse games from a database. A user can make an account to be able to view all games, add to their wishlist. and write their own reviews on games. Each user will have a profile that displays all of their info such as name and username, as well as their wishlist and game reviews. An admin user can log in and have the options to remove users and remove reviews. 

## Technical Requirements:
Unless it's modified by a stretch goal (see below), the following are strict technical
requirements.
1. Manage 4-7 database tables (entities) that are independent concepts. A simple
bridge table doesn't count.
2. MySQL for data management
3. Spring Boot, MVC, JDBC, Testing, and Security
4. An HTML and CSS UI that's built with React or Thymeleaf
5. At least one async JavaScript HTTP request for a Thymeleaf project
6. Sensible layering and pattern choices
7. At least one UI secured by role
8. A full test suite that covers the domain and data layers
